# 畢業專題 Graduation Project
在疫情期間，為了減少醫患接觸並提升診療效率，我們開發了一套使用者友善的脈搏測量系統。這個系統能自動偵測脈位並進行脈搏測量，旨在實現智慧醫療的應用。透過對測得的脈波進行分析，初步判斷可能的疾病，提供醫生決策的參考依據。

此專案不僅解決了疫情期間的接觸風險問題，還展示了智慧醫療技術在遠程健康監控中的潛力。我們的目標是在未來進一步開發，將測量結果遠端傳送給醫生，實現線上診療，從而提升醫療效率並降低醫療風險。

During the epidemic, in order to reduce doctor-patient contact and improve diagnosis and treatment efficiency, we developed a user-friendly pulse measurement system. This system can automatically detect pulse position and perform pulse measurement, aiming to realize smart medical applications. By analyzing the measured pulse waves, possible diseases can be initially determined and provided as a reference for doctors to make decisions.

This project not only solves the problem of exposure risks during the epidemic, but also demonstrates the potential of smart medical technology in remote health monitoring. Our goal is to further develop in the future to remotely transmit measurement results to doctors to achieve online diagnosis and treatment, thereby improving medical efficiency and reducing medical risks.
